NAME

    Tree::Path::Class - Tree for Path::Class objects

VERSION

    version 0.007

SYNOPSIS

        use Tree::Path::Class;
        use Path::Class;
    
        my $tree  = Tree::Path::Class->new( dir('/parent/dir') );
        my $child = Tree::Path::Class->new( file('child/file') );
        $tree->add_child($child);
    
        print $child->path->stringify;
        # /parent/dir/child/file

DESCRIPTION

    This module subclasses Tree to only accept Path::Class::Dir or
    Path::Class::File values, and provides a path attribute for retrieving
    the full path of a tree branch or leaf.

ATTRIBUTES

 path

    A read-only accessor that returns the tree's full Path::Class::Dir or
    Path::Class::File object, with all parents prepended.

METHODS

 FOREIGNBUILDARGS

    Coerces the parameter passed to new() into a Path::Class::Dir or
    Path::Class::File before passing it on to the superclass constructor.

 add_child

    Works just like the superclass' method. Plain Tree nodes will be
    recursively recreated as Tree::Path::Class nodes when added.

 meta

    Unlike Tree, this method provides access to the underlying Moose
    meta-object rather than a hashref of arbitrary metadata.
